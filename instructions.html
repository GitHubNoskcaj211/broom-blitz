        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Objective of Broom Blitz is to end the game with the highest score.</li>
          <li>Match length is 200 seconds.</li>
          <li>Play against another player or play against a CPU!</li>
          <li>Pause the game with escape.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Movement</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Move your player with WASD (player 1) and PL:' (player 2).</li>
          <li>Grab & throw the game balls with left shift (player 1) and right shift (player 2).</li>
          <li>An indicator around a ball will show up when you are able to grab it.</li>
          <li>Throwing a ball will launch it from in front of your player in the direction you are facing.</li>
          <li>When you are holding a ball you move slightly slower.</li>
          <li>There is a 250 ms delay from when you grab a ball to when you can throw it.</li>
          <li>There is a 750 ms delay to grab another ball when you throw a ball.</li>
          <li>There is a 750 ms delay to grab another ball when your ball is stolen (grabbed out of your hand by the opponent).</li>
          <li>You can only grab one ball at a time, and a ball will be thrown before another is grabbed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Scoring Ball</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The scoring ball is the small ball.</li>
          <li>Throwing the scoring into any of the opposing player goals will award you 10 points.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Hitting Ball</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are two large hitting balls.</li>
          <li>If the hitting ball hits a player it will stun them for a short period of time.</li>
          <li>A stunned player will drop their ball and cannot move or grab.</li>
          <li>If a hitting ball is thrown in the direction of the opponent, it will lock onto the opposing player for a short time.</li>
          <li>When not grabbed, the hitting ball AI will randomly roam the map.</li>
          <li>The test game below has the hitting ball AI turned off so you can learn movement. The real game has it turned on.</li>
